## Requirements

For deployment purposes I use `vercel-cli`, so you need to have it installed on your machine.

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

After that, you need to login to your Vercel account:

```bash
vercel login
```

For more information about the `vercel-cli`, you can check the [official documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/cli).

## Development

To run the project locally, you need to have `vercel-cli` installed on your machine.

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

Then you can run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
vercel dev
```

## Deployment

To deploy the project, you need to run the following command:

```bash
vercel
```
