## Requirements

For development purposes (`npm run dev`), I use [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) installed globally. If you don't have [nodemon](https://nodemon.io) installed you'll get an error. You could install it using the following command:

```sh
npm i -g nodemon
```

If you don't want to install it you could use `npm start` or `node index.js` instead of `npm run dev`.
